# Spotify to Local Library Sync
Potentially the most substantial task when trying to move away from using a streaming service to a locally hosted option 
such as Jellyfin is the acquisition of music that you had previously "collected". Part of that process is keeping track
of which songs you have managed to find. This tool aims to help by matching your saved songs in Spotify to the songs
you have stored locally.

## Features
- Sync to your Spotify account to retrieve all currently saved songs.
- Sync to your local music storage to retrieve all currently owned songs.
- Basic stats on the coverage of your saved Spotify songs you have with your local library.
- [*Future*] Fuzzy matching across potential matches where a perfect match can't currently be found.
- [*Future*] Update local songs' metadata with information from Spotify.
- [*Future*] Information about where you may be able to find unacquired songs.
